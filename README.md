# Gym Members Exercise Analysis

## 🚀 Project Overview

### Goal of the project:
Our goal was to help gym coaches or just regular gym rets like some of us to predict how many calories can one burn during a gym session based on such factors as age, gender, body characteristics, heart rate during the session and etc 
### Key Objectives:
1. **Understand user behavior:** Analyze exercise patterns, frequency, and preferences in workout types
2. **Discover trends:** Identify correlations and trends in the user data
3. **Predic calories burnt during the session:** Create an accurate ML model to predict calories burnt based on user demographics and exercise details
## 📂 Dataset

### Source:
- [Gym Members Exercise Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/gym-members-exercise-dataset)

### Description:
The dataset includes:
- **User demographics:** Gender, age, weight, height, BPM, BMI, fat percentage
- **Exercise details:** Session duration, workout type, exersice level, water intake, calories burnt

### File Used:
- `gym-members-exercise-dataset.csv`

## 🔍 Analysis Details

### Main Steps in Analysis:
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Checked for missing values and inconsistencies
   - Performed data type conversions and filtering
   - Feature engineering

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualized key metrics using matplotlib and seaborn
   - Analyzed trends in gym usage across demographics and time

3. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Calculated correlations between exercise patterns and demographics
   - Evaluated frequency and duration distributions

4. **Predictions:**
   - Computing an ML model to predict the goal metric – calories burnt during the session

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies
